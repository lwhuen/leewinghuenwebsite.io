        <p>Good morning sir and madam. I am Lee Wing Huen. I am a graduate student with a
            bachelor's degree in Economics and Finance at Hong Kong Shue Yan University.
            My first full-time job was as a clerk at a primary school. I assisted in the daily operation of the school's
            library and did paperwork. For example, I needed to handle the inventory of the books and do the quotation.
            Besides, I had to update the website and promote the school activities using self-made videos and posters.
            And,
            I need to assist the school activities and different works assigned by the teachers. The biggest gain from
            this
            job is that even though I don't know everything, I can teach myself from the internet and books, especially
            in
            this internet era.<br>
            <br>
            My previous job was working at Tseung Kwan O hospital as an executive assistant in the specialist outpatient
            clinic.
            My working department was the new case appointment booking office. I gained a lot of communication skills
            and experience in handling patients.
            I can multitask because I need to book appointments, answer inquiries and receive phone calls
            simultaneously.
            At first, I wasn't coping with these entire things very well because I was new to this department.
            Then, I made my notes, study the information from the internet, and pay attention to how my colleagues
            handle
            different tasks and inquiries.
            I learned a lot from them and throughout my attempts. I learned how to cope with stress and negative emotion
            throughout this job.
            Sometimes, people are impolite to me. And we need to face 200 to 300 patients per day.
            I need to stay calm in different situations and solve their problems. And do not let the negative vibe
            affect
            me.
            Managing emotion in the workplace and the communication skills I learned can apply to my future work.<br>
            <br>
            Currently, I work at the Bank of China. I am a project management assistant in the IT department.
            It gave me a better understanding of the workflow of the industry. I have to assist with the daily operation
            of
            the division.
            I communicated and coordinated with different teams. I collected questionnaires about testing and
            administrative
            work from them.
            Also, I handled and managed the records of contracts with vendors and contractors.
            Recently, I made different inventory works like contracts and electronic devices because it is the end of
            the
            year.
            It is a difficult task for me. I need to communicate with and urge my colleagues to give me what I want.<br>
            <br>
            I prefer to work on technical stuff. I enjoy building things.
            Last month, I joined a beginner course in Java. Even if I need to take the lesson after work, I feel the
            enthusiasm and joy of learning programming.
            Thus, this job is an opportunity to pursue what I want. Also, I plan to learn more about web page
            development
            and apply for a course in computer science.
